Additional sources
==================

Source for lib/rdoc/generator/template/darkfish/js/jquery.js (which is minified
and thus cannot be properly modified as is) is available at
debian/jquery-1.6.2.js.

When libruby2.0 is installed, however,
/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/rdoc/generator/template/darkfish/js/jquery.js is a symlink
to jquery.js provided by the libjs-jquery package.
